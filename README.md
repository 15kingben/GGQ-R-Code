# GGQ-R-Code
Simulation results for "Constructing dynamic treatment regimes in infinite-horizon settings"

The simulation results for each scenario are generated by the following R scripts.

File description:

Generate_Date.R: This code generates the simulated data used in the paper. 

GGQ-Algorithm.R: This code is used to eatimate the parameters.

Source-theta_standard_errors.R: This code calculates the standard errors for the estimated parameters using the formula in Theorem 1.
